Installation/Deployment:

Throughout the process of building and testing the application we took advantage of the developer and debugging mode with an Android phone. With a physical connection from the phone to the development computer via a USB we were able to quickly launch an application from the Eclipse Android developer environment. In order for the application to be useful past development and to be installable by any user, additional steps are needed. Any Android application needs to be packaged in the Android Package format, or more commonly known as a .apk file. 

To do this we needed to export the project via the Eclipse Android export wizard. This makes the process very straightforward and efficient. First, we simply choose which Android project to export. Next we need to choose a key store to identify ourselves with the application. This is necessary for uploading any application to the Google Play Store. If there is no key store already made, then one must be created. It is useful to note that many applications may be associated with a key store. Next an alias needs to be made to associate a key to the specific application. A password must also be created that will be associated with this key, and will be entered each time a developer wishes to export and sign the application. After all this is done the Application’s apk will be saved to wherever the developer wishes. Once placed on an android phone it may be selected which will then have the Android operating system prompt the user notifying them of any permissions requested by the application before it installs. If  the user agrees the application will be successfully installed and may be easily launched like normal.

Configuration:

The two Python scripts are the only components that have configuration options. To configure floodWifiChannel.py, there are two variables in the script named remote_ip and remote_port that are a string and an integer, respectively. The remote_ip variable should be set to the gateway IP address or configuration server IP address of your home router, while the remote_port should be the port that you wish to flood (we recommend port 80 so that you can also drain the resources of the configuration page web server). The setRandomMAC.py script has one configurable variable device that is a string and should be set to the device that you wish to spoof. In a terminal, you can execute the command ifconfig to get a list of devices. ‘en0’ and ‘en1’ are typical Ethernet device names for a machine. The reason that these scripts do not have command line variables is due to the nature of the SL4A application, which does not support them.
